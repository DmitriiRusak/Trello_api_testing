<!-- Some of the feature files consist of scenarios that are designed to be executed one by one, in other words they have
kind of logic and can not be independent of each other. These scenarios are not included in parallel testing, since I run
parallel testing at the scenario level and by following these approuch it is needed to be all scenarios to be independent-->
