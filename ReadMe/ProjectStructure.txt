Contains classes that are TestNG.xml runners, each of them, accordingly by name, represents module/feature of aut
and responsible for execution corresponding feature. The exception is only AllAPIModuleTest.xml class, that is
responsible for execution all tests of RestAssured part of a project, in other words, in order to run all tests
execute this class.
