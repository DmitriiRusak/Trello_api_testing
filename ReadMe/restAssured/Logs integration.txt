For logs integration in a RestAssured part of a project was used log4j2 library.
The logs integration includes:
1) LogFactory class. responsible for logger instance.
2) Methods marked with annotation @BeforeClass in a api.tests classes.
3) MyRestAssuredFilter - to log request/response specification, in other words to document all HTTP details.
4)TestListener - listen for test behavior and result.

All logs are stored in a file - logs/app.log

The strategy for storing logs in a file was accomplished with use of RollingFile appender, and SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy which converts
log file in a chosen archive file when .log file size exceeds the specified limit. In other words when .log file will grow to big, it
will be converted, archived and stored in the same directory as .log file. But not more than 10 copies.
