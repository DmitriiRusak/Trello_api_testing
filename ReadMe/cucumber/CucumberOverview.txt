The application for testing is - Trello.com
The example mapping was done with help of Miro, refer to - https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIjAyXL0=/

The use of cucumber in a project starts with module testing.
For that very basic functional parts (feature) of aut (AUT - application under test) was considered as:
- Board
- List
- Card

Each feature (module) is represented with appropriate directory with feature files in it
location is - src/test/resources/cucumberFeatures

Accordingly to example mapping one feature (module) of uat is processed with several user stories.
Each user story is represented on separate .feature file, and might consist of one or several Scenario (test cases)

Step definition are located at - src/test/java/api/cucumber/stepDefinition, and mostly presented in an appropriate to
feature (module) package, with similar name.

After module testing is done, and with all the stepdefinition classes that was created for that, it is possible, with help
of cucumber tags, to reorganize the order in which to run the scenarios. So was created separate runner classes for Smoke
testing, and EndToEnd testing.
The location of all runners in a project - src/test/java/api/cucumber/runners
The logic, and scenarios that was included in a specific runner (with help of cucumber tags),
see matrix, refer to - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DUbiyQ5LOpycLbh3UpXPpV653Kjts6JMXgRDnro3ZDI/edit?gid=0#gid=0
