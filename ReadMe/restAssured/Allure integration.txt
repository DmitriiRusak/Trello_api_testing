The Allure report is created and maintained with:
- allure annotations on a tests itself with use of: @Epic(""), @Feature(""), @Tag(""), @Description(""), @Severity("").                                                   @Severity(SeverityLevel.NORMAL)
- @Step annotations on a service layer.

Each method in any service class has annotation @Step with well described actions being done at that point,
which gives the execution tracking of any test that was executed even if it was in a precondition methods.
