For logs integration in a RestAssured part of a project was used:

- TestNG Test listener concept - utils.TestListener class
- Method that marked with annotation @BeforeSuite in services.ServiceWorkShop.projectSetUp().
- Additional logs in an ApiClient class - utils.ApiClint.restAssuredLogsIntegration()

All logs are stored in a file - logs/app.log

The strategy for storing logs in a file was accomplished with use of RollingFile appender, and SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy which converts
log file in a chosen archive file when .log file size exceeds the specified limit. In other words when .log file will grow to big, it
will be converted, archived and stored in the same directory as .log file.

The reason for adding additional logs in an ApiClient class - some test classes contains methods with @BeforeClass annotation in which it is used
the same HTTP request/response mechanism as in a tests, but since those methods technically not a tests, TestNG TestListener concept do
not listen for the events in them, so in case of an error/failure in them, there is no way to represent logs for debug purpose.
